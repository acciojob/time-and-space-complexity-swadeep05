  <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. 
    An algorithm with lower time complexity is more efficient because it performs fewer operations as the input grows.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> defines the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. 
    For example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input.
